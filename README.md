# Income-Expenditure App With Laravel

-   I am making this project with:
    -   Laravel Framework
    -   Fortify for authentication
    -   Ajax
    -   Jquery
    -   Bootstrap

## Check my app!

You can [register](https://app1.tolgin.com/register) to app.
There is a role system. When you register, your role will be guest. That means, you can only see what is going on inside the project.
You can not create, update or delete anything. Feel free to check my app and help me improve the app and the mistakes.
